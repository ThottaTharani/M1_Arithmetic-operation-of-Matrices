# INTRODUCTION
- Arithmetic operations of Matrices: The following application will be able to help any students and engineers to compute the values of matrices to solve any problem easily.As matrix calculation is mandatory in every field like numerical analysis, many computational problems are solved by reducing them to a matrix computation, and this involves often to compute with matrices of huge dimension. It will be able to do the following : 1. Transpose of a matrix: 2. Addition of matrices 3. Subtraction of Matrices. 4. scalar multiplication of matrices 5. multiplication of matrices.
