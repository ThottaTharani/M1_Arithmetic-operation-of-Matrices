# INTRODUCTION
- Arithmetic operations of Matrices: The following application will be able to help any students and engineers to compute the values of matrices to solve any problem easily.As matrix calculation is mandatory in every field like numerical analysis, many computational problems are solved by reducing them to a matrix computation, and this involves often to compute with matrices of huge dimension. It will be able to do the following : 1. Transpose of a matrix: 2. Addition of matrices: 3. Subtraction of Matrices: 4. scalar multiplication of matrices: 5. multiplication of matrices:.
# RESEARCH
- Matrix calculations are different from the normal numerical operation.An existing hands on calculator can perform arithmetic operations on matrices only upto the order of 4 but in this matix calculation application we can perform operation of n order matrices.The real time application of matrices are 1.Matrices are used in the science of optics to account for reflection and for refraction.2. Matrices are also useful in electrical circuits and quantum mechanics and resistor conversion of electrical energy.3. Matrices are used to solve AC network equations in electric circuits.
